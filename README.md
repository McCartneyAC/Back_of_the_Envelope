can we build a basic point-and-click regression analysis tool with R shiny? 


## The goal:

Build a general purpose regression tool, incorporating extensions to regression such as heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, clustered standard errors, multilevel modeling, and logistic regression. 

## Subgoal: 

Use combinations of `wired.js` and the R `xkcd` package to make the entire thing look goofy and hand drawn so that no one takes it seriously. 



With sufficient on-your-own data preparation, this tool should be sufficient for basic regression analyses for beginner-to-intermediate level social-science use. I have no plans to implement latent-variable / structural equation modeling at this time. 

## To Do: 
* ~Output should include `SjPlot`'s `tab_model()` output for APA-style regression tables~
* * there be dragons with clustered standard errors
* `ggplot2` representations of the model
* * ~bivariate~
* * ~bivariate residual plot~
* * two independent variables
* * added variable plots
* * Plot residuals. (it's just [predicted v actual] + ~[residual v fitted]~)
* ~Additionally, need to figure out how to modify the DT with `%>%` to round `psych::describe()` to two decimal places.~
* ~include correlation table from `SjPlot`~
* ~include data table~
* ~include `psych::describe()`~
* ~Robust Specification~ 
* ~Logistic Regression up and running~
* ~Multivariate Regression Up and running~
* clusters:
* * Linear Mixed
* * fixed effects (just make it add `factor()` of whatever variable to the data, then update the model to include this)
* * * option to eliminate coefficients with `felm()`
* * standard errors (this will make error for SjPlot see his tweet reply on this topic)
* ~Additional common filetypes supported. (stata, spss, csv, excel)~
* * need to add support for google sheets ????
* ~fix odd error with spaces in variable names~
* Instrumental variables / two-stage least squares? (Save for 1.2)
* ~margins plots~
* Outlier Analysis:
* * Cook's Distance Calculator (onHover over ggplot)
* * Leverage Calculator?
* * Influence index plot (from `car`, can it be remade in `ggplot2` though?)
* Adjust `SjPlot`'s marginsplot to include a dotted line at 0 for reference. 
* * or 1 for logistic obv. 
* * `plot_model(m1, vline.color = "red")` (it's already built in to SjP)
* * Also: `plot_model(m1, show.values = TRUE, value.offset = .3)`
* Additional Wired elements: Cards (for left panel)
* fancy shiny? https://www.r-bloggers.com/forget-about-excel-use-these-r-shiny-packages-instead/
* Deployable as a package with a single function to run the app in browser
* use `broom` or other tidymodels packages to clean up -> `SjPlot` reporting. 
* Quantiles? `geom_quantile()`

With a sufficient amount of effort, this could actually be a pretty good tool for multilevel linear modeling, ~provided I can figure out what exactly the error was with `mice`'s MCMC imputation.~ imputation is gonna have to wait for v1.2 at the absolute earliest.

(use this for model work)
